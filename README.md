# Customer-Satisfaction-Analysis
Machine Learning project focused on analyzing airline passenger satisfaction. Includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling to evaluate key factors affecting customer experience.
Customer-Satisfaction-Analysis

This project applies Machine Learning techniques to analyze and predict airline passenger satisfaction. The workflow includes:

Data Preprocessing – handling missing values, encoding categorical features, scaling

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – visualizing trends, distributions, and correlations

Feature Engineering – extracting insights from service, travel, and demographic data

Modeling & Prediction – training classification models to predict passenger satisfaction

Evaluation – comparing model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Objectives

Identify factors that most influence airline customer satisfaction

Build predictive models to classify passengers as satisfied or dissatisfied

Provide actionable insights for improving airline service quality

Tech Stack

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook for development and visualization

Machine Learning for classification modeling
