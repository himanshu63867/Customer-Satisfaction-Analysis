# Customer-Satisfaction-Analysis
Machine Learning project focused on analyzing airline passenger satisfaction. Includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling to evaluate key factors affecting customer experience. The workflow includes:

Data Preprocessing – handling missing values, encoding categorical features, scaling

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – visualizing trends, distributions, and correlations

Feature Engineering – extracting insights from service, travel, and demographic data

Modeling & Prediction – training classification models to predict passenger satisfaction

Evaluation – comparing model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
